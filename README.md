A few scripts to make job applications easier.

The blacklist file uses the 'Shortlist' feature as a blacklist.
If you don't want to do that, the second file allows you to remove applied jobs from the table.

Both of these options make it easier to search through available jobs.

I suggest using these scripts in conjunction with this chrome extension:

The script can be set to automatically run on a specific page.
